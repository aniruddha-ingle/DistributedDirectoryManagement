# Distributed Directory Management
This project is a distributed system based on the client-server architecture. The client and server both have GUIs built using the SWING framework. The client GUI provides terminal like usability with some additional features for the users of this system. The user can use the GUI to send text commands to interact with the server or use the buttons provided which are linked to frequent funcitonality. The server has two tabs. One tab is to show realtime feedback of the various operations performed and the other tab is to display logs.
